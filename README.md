This project provides a simple example of a modal (full screen) component. It is based on https://github.com/rmemory/react-portal-example.

Additionally, it provides an example of using a styled-component (rather than the typical CSS). Also note the implementation of the modal isn't requiring any special state other than the boolean in Toggle.
